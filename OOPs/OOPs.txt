## Object: Entities in real world
## Classes: Group of these Entities or Blueprint of Object 

## Access Modifier / Access specifier
Access Modifier - within class  - within package  -  Outside package by subclass only  - Outside package

1. Private      -     Y         -      N          -            N                       -      N
2. Default      -     Y         -      Y          -            N                       -      N
3. Protected    -     Y         -      Y          -            Y                       -      N
1. Public       -     Y         -      Y          -            Y                       -      Y


## Getter/setter
Get - to return the value
set - to modify the value

This: This keyword is used to refer to the current Object



## Constructor
Constructor: Constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.

1. It is used to initialize the values of instance variables.
2. It is used to set the initial state of an object.
3. Constructor have the same name as class or structure
4. Constructor don't have a return type. (Not even a void)
5. Constructor are only called once, at object creation
6. memory allocation happens when Constructor is called.

example: Pen p1 = new Pen();

** Constructor overloading: When there are mutiple Constructor is created with different parameters
with same name at that time main fucntion search the suitable Constructor as per the requirement and
this is called Constructor overloading. and also it is an example of polyporphism


## Concept of OOPs / main pillers of OOPs

1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data and methods under a single unit. It also implements data hiding. 
2. Inheritance: Inheritance is when properties and methods of base class are passed on to a derived class.
